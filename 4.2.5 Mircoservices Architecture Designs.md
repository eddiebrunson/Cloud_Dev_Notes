#### Properties of Microservices

### Communication
* Services communicate through a network
* REST is currently the most-commonly used network interface

### Independently Deployed
* Deployment to one service should not affect another

### Fault tolerant
* Diligence in writing code that can anticipate when another microservice isnâ€™t working

Key Terms - Microservices
Term	Definition
REST	Architectural style of communication across a network
Fault Tolerance	The ability to continue operating in the event of a failure
Vertical Scaling	Scaling by increasing the capacity of existing machines
Horizontal Scaling	Scaling by adding more machines


### Alternatives to REST
While REST is the most popular form of network communication used for microservices, there are many other protocols that can be used. The following are some other ways microservices can communicate with one another:

## Lesson 5: Orchestration with Kubernetes

### 9. Kubernetes Cluster 

At this point, we have a Kubernetes cluster set up and understand how YAML files can be created to handle the deployment of pods and expose them to consumers. Moving forward, weâ€™ll be using the Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, to interact with our cluster.

### Interacting With Your Cluster
* [Install](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html) `kubectl`
* [Set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-aws-iam-authenticator.html) `aws-iam-authenticator`
* [Set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html) `kubeconfig`
### Loading YAML files
* `kubectl apply` - create deployment and service

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

### Introductory Commands
`kubectl` provides a wide range of commands to interact with Kubernetes. The following are some basic commands that we can use to interact with our current cluster.

* `kubectl get pods` - show the pods in the cluster
* `kubectl describe services` - show the services in the cluster
* `kubectl cluster-info` - display information about the cluster

## Lesson 2: REST API

### 9. Sending Requests



Single-Origin request policy is enabled in all browsers by default and is an important security measure. To send requests from a web application to a different domain (e.g. from localhost to API Gateway domain) we need to configure Cross-Origin request policy in our API.

Alternatively, we need to configure our application so that JavaScript would be served from the same domain that is used for our REST API, but this goes beyond the scope of this course.

### 9. Divide into Microservices 

### Map Your Dependencies
* It's important to understand the application you're working with before breaking it apart.
* One strategy is to map out the modules and their dependencies as a directed graph to understand the downstream impact of your changes.

### Where to Start?
* Thereâ€™s no hard rule: choose the part of the application that makes the most sense to you.
* Dependency graph serves merely as a guideline on risk based on the number of dependencies.
* A module with the least dependencies will potentially have the downstream effects meaning less risk.

### How to Start?
The Strangler pattern is a common and effective way to migrate legacy applications.
Rather than replacing your code with a new version, you can gradually replace components of your application.

### Shared Code
Code duplication can be abstracted into common libraries used across projects.

### Key Terms - Refactoring

| Dependency Graph |   A diagram that maps out the relationships between components to understand which parts of the system rely on the other      |
| Module |   Program that is logically grouped together to execute a specific functionality    |
| Strangler Pattern |  Strategy of refactoring code by incrementally replacing components of the codebase    |	  
| Technical Debt |  The concept of choosing an easier implementation of software that will need to be reworked   |

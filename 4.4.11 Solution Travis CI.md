## Lesson 4: Auomating the Application Development Lifcycle 


### 11. Solution: Travis CI

The completed Travis file should be composed of 4 parts:

1. `language`
2. `services`
3. `before_script`
4. `script`

The full solution is shown below:

```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 13

services:
  - docker

# Pre-testing installs
install:
  - echo "nothing needs to be installed"

# Scripts to be run such as tests
before_script:
  - echo "no tests"

script:
  - docker --version # print the version for logging
  - docker build -t simple-node .
  - docker tag simple-node YOUR_DOCKER_HUB/simple-node:latest

after_success:
  - echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
  - docker push YOUR_DOCKER_HUB/simple-node
```

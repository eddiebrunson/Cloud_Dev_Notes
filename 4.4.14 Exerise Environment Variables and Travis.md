### 14. Exercise: Environment Variables and Travis

#### Using Environment Variables with Travis
With our exercise, we want to use environment variables as part of the Travis CI build process. Configure the Simple Node project to print out a value that was set as an environment variable.

#### Environment Variables in NodeJS Review
We can set environment variables locally using the command: `export VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE`

For NodeJS to pick up the environment variable to be used, we use `process.env`.

To illustrate, if we set an environment variable with `export FAVORITE_FOOD=pizza`, we can programmatically reference the value in NodeJS as follows:

const favoriteFood = process.env.FAVORITE_FOOD;
console.log(`My favorite food is ${favoriteFood}`);

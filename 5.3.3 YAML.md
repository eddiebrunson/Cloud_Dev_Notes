If you are new to YAML, here is a useful link to a blog on YAML. [YAML tutorial](https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/)

Here is a free tool that was mentioned in the video that can convert YAML code to JSON and vice versa: https://www.json2yaml.com/

YAML example:
```yaml
complex:
  nested:
    key1: value1
    key2: value2
  anotherNested:
    key: value
list:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 33
  ```

## Lesson 6: Best Practices 

### 6. Canary Deployment 

Two approaches to deployment: 

1. Deploying a New Version 
   * Blue/Green Deployment 
       * Maintain two versions of the application 
          * Blue - current(old) version
          * Green - new version 
   * Switch all users to a new version
   * Rollback if any issues

2. Canary Deployment 
   * Maintain two versions of the application 
   * Direct a small percentage of the users/request to a new version
        * if fine - shift more traffic
        * if not - rollback

### 14. Using Logs

### Key Points
* Software is rarely free of errors so we need to troubleshoot errors when they occur.
* In production environments we don't have tools like breakpoints that could help us identify bugs
* Logging can get complicated so we need tools to handle logs and make it easy to search them.
* System logs used for debugging are sometimes different from error messages returned by API's.

### Strategies for Logging
* Use timestamps to know when the activity occurred
* Set a consistent style of logging to make it easier to parse log output
* Use process IDs to trace an activity
* Rotate logs so they don't fill up your storage
* Include stack traces in your logs
* Look at the delta in message timestamps to measure execution time

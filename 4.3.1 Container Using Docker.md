## Lesson 3: Containers Using Docker

### 1. Containers Using Docker

### Your Code is Not a Black Box...Yet
* Applications often require many packages and dependencies to run properly
* It’s common for an application to work on one computer but not another

### Deployment Headaches
* Organizations often have different development environments. These often include development and production.
* Deploying and testing the same code across different environments can be cumbersome

* It is common for code to work in a development environment and not behave as expected in production

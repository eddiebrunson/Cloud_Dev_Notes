# 5. Develop & Deploy Serverless App
___

## Lesson 1: Serverless Introduction

### 2. Function as a Service 


### Serverless Components
* **FaaS** : Function as a service: write code in individual functions and deploy them to a platform to be executed
* **Datastores**: Storage of data
* **Messaging**: Send messages from one application to another
* **Services**: Services that provide functionalities where we don't need to manage servers; i.e. authentication, ML, video processing

### Function as a Service
* Split application into small functions
* Event driven
* Pay per invocation
* Rest is handled by a cloud provider

### Lambda function vs AWS Lambda
Keep in mind that AWS Lambda is a computing service that runs code in response to events from Amazon Web Services, while a Lambda function is a single function connected to an event source running in AWS Lambda.

### AWS Lambda limitations
* At most 3GB of memory per execution
* Functions can run no more that 15 minutes
* Can only write files to /tmp folder
* Limited number of concurrent executions
* Event size up to 6 MB

Keep in mind that those limits are subject to change. You can find most recent AWS Lambda limits [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html).

### Example of a Function (AWS Lambda)

```Javascript
exports.handler = (event) => {
    const number = event.number 
    const updateNum = number++ 
    return {
        result: updatedNum
    }
}
```

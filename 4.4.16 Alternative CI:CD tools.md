### 16. Alternative CI/CD tolls

Docker is more-or-less the defacto standard for containers. Build tools, on the other hand, arenâ€™t as standardized. Travis is one of many CI/CD tools that are popular. Other ones include Jenkins, CircleCI, AWS CodeBuild. You may choose one depending on your business needs.

* [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) - most flexible but more overhead of setup
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) - alternative to Travis CI with many competing features
* [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) - integrates easily with other AWS tools

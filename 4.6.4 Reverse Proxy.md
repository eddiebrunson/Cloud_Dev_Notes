### 4. Reverse Proxy

### Reverse Proxy
* A single interface that forwards requests on behalf of the client and appears to the client as the origin of the responses.
* Useful for abstracting multiple microservices to appear as a single resource.
### API Gateway
A form of a reverse proxy that serves as an abstraction of the interface to other services.

### Sample Reverse Proxy
* Nginx is a web server that can be used as a reverse proxy. Configurations can be specified with an `nginx.conf` file.
Sample bare-bones `nginx.conf` file:

```conf 
events {
}
http {
  server {
      listen <PORT_NUMBER>;
      location /<PROXY_PATH>/ {
          proxy_pass http://<REDIRECT_PATH>/;
      }
  }
}
```

Here is the code I used in the demo:

nginx.conf

```config
events {
}
http {
    server {
        listen 8080;
        location /api/ {
            proxy_pass http://my-app-2-svc:8080/;
        }
    }
}
```
deployment.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    service: reverseproxy
  name: reverseproxy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        service: reverseproxy
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: YOUR_DOCKER_HUB/simple-reverse-proxy
        name: reverseproxy
        imagePullPolicy: Always          
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "1024Mi"
            cpu: "500m"       
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      restartPolicy: Always
```
service.yaml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    service: reverseproxy
  name: reverseproxy-svc
spec:
  ports:
  - name: "8080"
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    service: reverseproxy
```
### Commands
The commands that we use to deploy the reverse proxy are the same as that used to deploy the application. `kubectl` is used as our tool to interface with our cluster and the YAML file specifies the configuration for our reverse proxy.

* `kubectl apply <REVERSE_PROXY_DEPLOYMENT>.yaml`
* `kubectl apply <REVERSE_PROXY_SERVICE>.yaml`

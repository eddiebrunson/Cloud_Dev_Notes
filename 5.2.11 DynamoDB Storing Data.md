### 11. DynamoDB: Storing Data



### DynamoDB Capacity Modes

DynamoDB has two capacity modes:

* **Provisioned capacity** - we need to define the maximum amount of read/write requests DynamoDB can handle. The higher the limit we set, the more we have to pay per month. Requests are throttled if we go above the specified limit.
* **On-Demand** - DynamoDB will handle as many requests as we send, and we pay per-request. Can be more expensive comparing to Provisioned capacity, but is better for applications with unpredictable traffic patterns

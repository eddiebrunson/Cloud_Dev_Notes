## Lesson 3: Serverless Framework

### 11. Validate Requests



### Requests Validation
You can read more about requests validation with API Gateway in the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-method-request-validation.html).

If you need a refresher for JSON schema, please do check out at its official documentation website

JSON schema example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "my-type",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

Requests validation is now natively supported by Serverless framework, and there is no need to use any external plugins.

To enable requests validation one need is to add the following to the serverless.yml:
```yml
  HttpHandler:
    handler: src/lambda/http/create.handler
    events:
      - http:
          method: post
          path: items
          request:
            # Schema that will be used to validate incoming requests
            schema:
              application/json: ${file(models/create-todo-model.json)}
```

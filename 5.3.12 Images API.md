### Composite key

A composite key in DynamoDB consists of two elements

* Partition key - what partition to write item to
* Sort key - to sort elements with the same partition key

Together - uniquely identify an item, meaning there can be no two items in a table with the same values of composite key.

NOTE. If a table has a composite key, there can be multiple items with the same partition key, providing they have different values of sort key.

Composite keys allows to perform queries, that can be used to get a subset of items with a specified partition key.

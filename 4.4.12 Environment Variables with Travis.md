### 12. Environment Variables with Travis 

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are a useful way to handle variables that shouldn’t be hard-coded into our application. These values are often credentials that shouldn’t be stored in the code.

### Environment Variables with Travis
Travis provides a way to set environment variables without having them exposed. These values will be used during the Travis build process.

1. In your TravisCI dashboard, navigate to a repository
2. Navigate to the Settings screen
3. Set values in Environment Variables

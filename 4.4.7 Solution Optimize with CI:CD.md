## Lesson 4: Auomating the Application Development Lifcycle 


### 7. Solution: Optimize with CI/CD

By using a CI/CD pipeline, we reduce the risk of failed deployments from user error. All of these steps can become automated. If there is an issue with the deployed code, a user can revert the changes with an older container rather than backtracking by using older code and downgrading packages and dependencies.

* Reduce risk of failed deployments
* Connecting to a production environment is a security risk
* Backing up the code is not always a comprehensive backup of the existing state since we may have other dependencies such as databases
* Packages and dependencies may have to be downgraded and would introduce downtime

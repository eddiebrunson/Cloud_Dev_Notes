## Lesson 5: Orchestration with Kubernetes

### 2. Why Orchestration?

### Orchestration is the automated management of the lifecycle of our application

* With CI/CD, if Travis is our CI tool, then Kubernetes is our CD tool
* Orchestration helps us handle complicated workflows in deploying our application
* Helps us automate our deployment process for continuous deployment

### Orchestration helps with:

1. Deploy code
2. Recovering from failure
3. Scale horizontally

One of the main benefits of a orchestration tool is the ability to monitor the help of our application. 

Now we have a CI process that automatically takes our code and creates Docker images. Then with service orchestration, we fill in our CD process to complete our software development life-cycle. 

Since our applications are run inside of containers, they can be deployed as one unit.

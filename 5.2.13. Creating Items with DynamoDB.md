### 13. Creating Items with DynamoDB



In this course Lambda functions generate random UUIDs and use them as IDs of created items. They do not check if these UUIDs are unique, so you might be wondering, what would happen if two function calls generate the same ID? This is called a collision, and depending on how we configure a request it will either overwrite an existing item or will cause an error.

Fortunately the probability of this event is so [low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions) that we can safely ignore it in practice. Because of this UUIDs are [commonly used as IDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#As_database_keys) in databases.

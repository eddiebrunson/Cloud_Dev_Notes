## Lesson 6: Best Practices/Design Patterns for Kubernetes in Production

### 3. Thinking about Production

#### Production-ready
Deployed applications for production-use are different than ones we use for development. We have to make additional considerations as the application is no longer running in our isolated environment.

### Restrict Access
* Follow properties of least-privilege to secure our application.
### Scale
* Be able to handle the number and size of user requests.
### Availability
* Ensure that the application is responsive and able to be used when needed.

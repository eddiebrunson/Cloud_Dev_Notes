## Lesson 5: Orchestration with Kubernetes

### 3. Kubernetes Fundamentals

### Key Points

### Kubernetes
* A container orchestration system packed with features for automating our applicationâ€™s deployment
* Enables us to easily scale our application and ship new code

### Pods
* Containers often need to communicate with one another. It's not uncommon to see a deployment involving a few containers to be deployed.
* Kubernetes pods are abstractions of multiple containers and are also ephemeral.
### Services
* Applications are often deployed with multiple replicas. This helps with load balancing and horizontal scaling.
* Services are an abstraction of a set of pods to expose them through a network.

| **Term**    |  **Definition** |
| :---        |        :----:   |
|  Horizontal Scaling| Handling increased traffic by creating additional replicas so that traffic can be divided across the replicas      |
|  Kubernetes Service  |  An abstraction of a set of pods and interface for how to interact with the pods   |
| Pods  |  A set of containers that are deployed together   |
|     Load Balancing    | Handling traffic by distributing it across different endpoints
|     Replica     |  A redundant copy of a resource often used for backups or load balancing   |                                    
|  Consumer  | An external entity such as a user or program that interfaces with an application    |

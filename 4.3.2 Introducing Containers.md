## Lesson 3: Containers Using Docker

### 2. Introducing Containers

Containers make our application one unit of deployment

### Your Code is Now Kind of a Black Box
* Containers are self-contained applications with all the dependencies needed to run
* Containers can be treated as one unit of deployment
* Rolling back code with containers is simply re-deploying an older snapshot

### Why Kind of?
* Containers make things easier but donâ€™t magically make deployment problems disappear
* Code may still work in one environment and fail in another, though now we have an understanding of what might have failed

### Containers are Ephemeral
* Containers should be stateless and are expected to be destroyed.

### Containers Help Manage Dependencies
* Each container can be running its own versioned software. We resolve the issue where different applications may have different dependencies.

### Simplify Deployment
* Containers are self-contained so deployment is simply swapping out an existing container with a new one.

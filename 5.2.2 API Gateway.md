## Lesson 2: REST API

### 2. API Gateway



When implementing REST API with AWS Lambda our functions receive HTTP requests in the form of events. Each event contains information like HTTP method, HTTP body, headers, etc.

A Lambda function should process this event and return a response that will be converted by AWS into an HTTP response.

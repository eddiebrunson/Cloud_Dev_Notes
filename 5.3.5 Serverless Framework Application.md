## Lesson 3: Serverless Framework

### 5. Serverless Framework Application 



Serverless Plugins
Serverless framework's functionality can be extended using dozens of plugins developed for it. During the course we will use some of the most popular plugins, and you will see when and how to use them.

When you are looking for a plugin for your project you can use the [plugins catalog](https://serverless.com/plugins/) on the Serverless Framework website.
If you can't find a plugin that would fit your needs, you can always implement your own. You can start with [this guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/plugins#writing-plugins) if you want to explore this option.

### Serverless Framework Events
If you want to learn more, you can find a full list of events that Serverless Framework supports in the [official documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/). It provides examples for every event they support and describe all parameters it supports.

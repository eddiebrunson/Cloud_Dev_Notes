## Lesson 5: Orchestration with Kubernetes

### 13. Alternative Deployment Strategies


Kubernetes is one solution for deploying your containers. It's packed with features but can sometimes be overwhelming. As we've mentioned before, choosing a tool comes with its own set of tradeoffs. Here are a few other popular technologies that are used in the industry today.

*  ### AWS ECS

AWS' proprietary solution that predates AWS EKS. It integrates very well with other AWS tools and is a bit more straightforward as it is not as feature-packed as Kubernetes. 

* ### AWS Fargate
AWS tool that helps streamline deploying containers to ECS and EKS. 

* ### Docker
It's an option to simply run the container manually with Docker. Sometimes, it's tempting to pick a shiny hot tool that may lead to overengineered architectures.

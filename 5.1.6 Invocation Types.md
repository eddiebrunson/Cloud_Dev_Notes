## Lesson 1: Serverless Introduction

### 6. Invocation types 



Errors are handled differently, depending on how we execute our function.

When we use a **Request/response** method: If there's an error in the function, then it will return immediately to the caller, which can process the error from the Lambda function.

When we use an **Async** method: Instead of returning an error to the user, AWSLambda will return HTTP 202 code to the user and it will store a request into an internal queue. Additionally, it will try to call the Lambda function up to 3 times. If all of those times result into an error, then it will store the event into a "dead-letter queue", which stores all the events that the Lambda function failed to process.
